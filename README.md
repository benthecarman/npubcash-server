## About The Project

Cashu Mints can offer a better and more sovereign custodial Lightning experience. However because eCash tokens are stored by the users themselves, offline receiving can be challenging. npub.cash introduces a LNURL service that generates tokens on received payments and holds on to them for a user, until they come back online. This is a reference implemenation of the npub.cash service written in Typescript.
